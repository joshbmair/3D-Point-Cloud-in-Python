This is the Python version of the Point Cloud assignment I had to do in one of my first computer science classes. The original assignment was in Java and fit only 2-dimensional points; however, I chose to rewrite this in Python and make points 3-dimensional as a challenge to myself.

A point is an object with an x, y, and z value like on a 3D Euclidian planea, and a cloud is a collection of points. Easy enough to understand.
